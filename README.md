# Consolidation_project
Repo for dice game prompt under the consolidation project for INST 126.

project steps (!!DELETE POST-CODING and REPLACE w/ FUNTIONALITY!!): 
1. Obviously DEFINITELY import random to generate dice num, pass 1- 6 as parameters. 
2. declare function for initialization, define target value and players (potentially add personalization feature, like picking your own names or adding more than two players? not sure)
3. make role dice function and use the imported random lib to generate rand number 1-6. 
4. create one big function storing all rolled values and printing to the screen. would be easier to also have the option of scoring the roll, rerolling, and rolling fixed dice all in this function w/ while if elif and else blocks
5. seperate function checking if the target value/max score is reached, + append points and print scores for players to keep track.
